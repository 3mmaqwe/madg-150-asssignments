# Media Arts and Game Design Assignments
#### Author: 3mmaqwe _AKA_ Emmaline Bateman  
Welcome to the Readme Page for the repository: [madg-150-assignments](https://github.com/3mmaqwe/madg-150-asssignments)

  below I will explain each of my assignments I have done for my MAGD 150 class at [**University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.**](http://www.uww.edu/)  
All the assignments are written within the program langauge [Processing](https://processing.org/), a language created to help people who are more visually oriented learn how to code.  

## Background Infomation  
 Before working on theses projects I had a small understanding of coding logic, but no knowledge of any programming language. I had in the past attempted to learn a coding language but had not gone anywhere with outside of the small basic tutorials I could find on the internet.   
 For my progess I have reached today, I give credit to: **Rhea Vichot, _my Proffessor_ & my Dad** both who helped me to get where I am today. Without their help I don't think I could have come to find new found passion for programming. 
 
 ## Assignment-1_city.pde
 This is the first project I made in this class. Though this program we learned about basic color infomation, shape funtions and how to set up a basic processing file. With these new funtions we need to create a sketch with the theme: city. 
 
 ## s18magd150lab02_Bateman.pde
 This the is second project I made in my 150 Magd class. In this project we learned about more shapes that we could draw with, and more ways to use color. The theme was Space.
