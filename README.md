# Media Arts and Game Design Assignments
#### Author: 3mmaqwe _AKA_ Emmaline Bateman  
Welcome to the Readme Page for the repository: [madg-150-assignments](https://github.com/3mmaqwe/madg-150-asssignments)

  below I will explain each of my assignments I have done for my MAGD 150 class at [**University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.**](http://www.uww.edu/)  
All the assignments are written within the program langauge [Processing](https://processing.org/), a language created to help people who are more visually oriented learn how to code.  

## Background Infomation  
 Before working on theses projects I had a small understanding of coding logic, but no knowledge of any programming language. I had in the past attempted to learn a coding language but had not gone anywhere with outside of the small basic tutorials I could find on the internet.   
 For my progess I have reached today, I give credit to: **Rhea Vichot: my Proffessor & my Dad** both who helped me to get where I am today. Without their help I don't think I could have come to find new found passion for programming.

 This is the first project I made in this class. Though this program we learned about basic color infomation, shape funtions and how to set up a basic processing file. With these new funtions we need to create a sketch with the theme: city.

 This the third project I made in my 150 Magd class. We learned a few different math properties and different tpyes of varibles that could be used in processing. The theme was screensavers. One of my favorite funtions I used in the program was the random(); funtion. I used this to randomly place the raindows thoughout the window.

  This the Fifth project I made in my 150 Magd class. this project we learned about button interaction, including how to know if the mouse was over the button, and how to tigger events if the mouse was pressed. In my project I had a simple on and off button, and a "next button" that would appear if the tv was on.
